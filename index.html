                    <h2>Hi,</h2>
                    <h1>I'm John, UX/UI Researcher and Designer.</h1>
                    <p>Iâ€™m a UX/UI professional specializing in user research that delivers impactful insights. 
                    Employing an empathetic approach to understand users and their needs. 
                    Solving complex user problems through clean, minimal designs and communicating insights across multiple teams to create unique solutions. 
                    Tools include Figma, Adobe XD, Miro, and InVision. 
                    My background in anthropology has given me experience in ethnographic research and cultural sensitivities. 
                    Thriving independently or within small teams. 
                    Previously worked with the US Forest Service in a research role and at The Clean Program as Director of Experience, now seeking full-time roles remotely or in-person.
